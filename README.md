QtSolution-QtWindowListMenu
===========================

The QtWindowListMenu widget provides MDI applications with a "Windows" menu entry that shows the available MDI windows and which window is currently active. It also has entries to close all windows, to cascade them, and other common functionality. QtWindowListMenu automatically keeps track of the windows in a QWorkspace.
